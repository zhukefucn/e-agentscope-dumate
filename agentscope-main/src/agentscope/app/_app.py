    This is the primary entry point for embedding AgentScope into an existing
    service or running it standalone.  All built-in routers are registered
    automatically; pass ``extra_middlewares`` to add your own.

    Usage — standalone::

        app = create_app(storage=RedisStorage())
        uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)

    Usage — mount onto an existing app::

        root = FastAPI()
        agentscope_app = create_app(storage=RedisStorage())
        root.mount("/agentscope", agentscope_app)

    Args:
        storage (`StorageBase`):
            The storage backend.  Its lifecycle (``__aenter__`` /
            ``__aexit__``) is managed by the app lifespan.
        workspace_manager (`WorkspaceManagerBase | None`, optional):
            The workspace manager.  When provided, its ``close_all`` is called
            on shutdown.  Pass a :class:`~agentscope.app._manager.
            LocalWorkspaceManager`
            for local-directory workspaces.
        extra_credentials (`list[Type[CredentialBase]] | None`, optional):
            Additional :class:`~agentscope.credential.CredentialBase`
            subclasses to register before the app starts.  Equivalent to
            calling :func:`~agentscope.credential.CredentialFactory.
            register_credential` for each class.
        extra_middlewares (`list[Middleware] | None`, optional):
            Additional ASGI middlewares to add to the application.
        title (`str`, defaults to ``"AgentScope"``):
            OpenAPI title shown in the docs UI.
        version (`str`, defaults to ``"2.0.0"``):
            API version shown in the docs UI.

    Returns:
        `FastAPI`: A fully configured application ready to serve requests.
